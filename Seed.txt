	Think about hate
	Think about getting fit
	And why I'm always late
	Think about tonight
	And what I'm going to do
	But I just can't concentrate
	Because I'm thinking about you
	
	Think about money
	Think what I owe
	Spent it on a car
	With a cool, cool stereo
	And I'm sitting in traffic	
	Wishing it would move
	Should been thinking about a job
	But I'm thinking about you
	
	Thinking about you
	Thinking about you now
	Think about your touch
	Think about your kiss
	Feeling like a kid again
	Total utter bliss
	(bis)

	Think about my holidays
	Think golden rays
	Think about dancing
	And sitting in the waves
	Now thinking about the time
	And the place where we met
	Swimming in the sea
	And your hair was all wet
	
	Think about colors
	Think about sex
	Think about your body
	How it moved in that dress
	Think about your touch
	Think about your kiss
	Feeling like a kid again
	Total utter bliss
	
	Total utter bliss...
	Thinking about you
	Thinking about you now
	
	Thinking about you
	Thinking about you now
	
	Thinking about you
	Thinking about you now
	Think about your touch
	Think about your kiss
	Feeling like a kid again
	Total utter bliss
	(bis)
